This year-long electrical and computer engineering capstone project involved the development of a system for the teleoperation of a robotic arm with haptic feedback. The project team consisted of two electrical engineers, tasked with the development and calibration of the sensor systems for the user and the robotic arm, and two computer engineers, tasked with the development of the control system for the robotic arm, the sensor data analysis and the communications between the sensor computer and the robot control computer.

The code was written primarily in C++, which was used to implement the network programming, sensor data reading and fusion, control input calculation, and control input sending through the Labvolt SDK.

Below is a list of the components and tasks that I personally completed:
    - High level system design
    - Initial project ideation
    - Selection and ordering of flex sensors, IMU, haptic motors
    - Selection of sensor glove components
    - Implementation of serial reading from Arduino
    - Implementation of wireless communication through sockets
    - Component testing (ranges of values from IMU, flex sensors, touch sensors)
    - Implementation of haptic responses through haptic motors
    - Implementation of transforming sensor data into control inputs
    - Implementation of using the robotic arm SDK to utilize the control inputs

The parts list for the sensor array can be seen below:

Below, a video of the demonstration of the project is available, showcasing the functionality of the robotic arm teleoperation system.

Unfortunately, several axes of rotation for the robot, as well as some planned haptic responses were left uncompleted due to the onset of COVID-19 and the subsequent graduations of the team members.
