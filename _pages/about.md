I am a recent graduate with an MSc in computer science with a focus on artificial intelligence. I am passionate about a variety of topics, including robotics, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and all manners of autonomous systems.

My industry experience has focused on software development for satellite communications systems for airplanes. This experience has allowed me to develop my skills with modern software practices, such as the agile methodology and various testing paradigms.

I am currently looking for new opportunities to contribute and improve my skill set in the spaces of machine learning and robotics.
